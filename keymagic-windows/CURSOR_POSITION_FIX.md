# Cursor Position Fix for KeyMagic TSF

## Issue
The cursor was appearing at the start of the composing string instead of at the end where users expect it to be when typing.

## Fix Applied
Updated the `UpdateCompositionString` method in `KeyMagicTextService.cpp` to:

1. After setting the composition text, collapse the range to the end position
2. Set the selection to this end position using `ITfContext::SetSelection`
3. Apply display attributes to the full composition range

## Code Changes
In `CEditSession::UpdateCompositionString`:
```cpp
// After setting text:
pRange->SetText(ec, 0, m_composingText.c_str(), static_cast<LONG>(m_composingText.length()));

// NEW: Move cursor to end
pRange->Collapse(ec, TF_ANCHOR_END);

TF_SELECTION tfSelection;
tfSelection.range = pRange;
tfSelection.style.ase = TF_AE_NONE;
tfSelection.style.fInterimChar = FALSE;

m_pContext->SetSelection(ec, 1, &tfSelection);
```

## To Apply This Fix

Since the TSF DLL is currently loaded by Windows, you need to:

1. **Unregister the current DLL**:
   - Run `unregister.bat` as Administrator
   - Or run: `regsvr32 /u C:\Users\thantthet\keymagic-v3\keymagic-windows\tsf\build\Release\KeyMagicTSF.dll`

2. **Release the DLL from memory**:
   - Log out and log back in
   - OR restart Windows
   - OR end all TSF-related processes (difficult and not recommended)

3. **Build the updated DLL**:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\thantthet\keymagic-v3\keymagic-windows\tsf\build
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

4. **Register the updated DLL**:
   - Run `register.bat` as Administrator
   - Or run: `regsvr32 C:\Users\thantthet\keymagic-v3\keymagic-windows\tsf\build\Release\KeyMagicTSF.dll`

## Alternative Development Workflow

For faster iteration during development:

1. Build to a different output name
2. Use version numbers in the DLL name
3. Maintain multiple versions for testing

## Expected Result
After applying this fix, the cursor should appear at the end of the composing text, making it clear to users where their next character will appear.
