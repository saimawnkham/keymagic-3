# KeyMagic Windows Reorganization Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Reorganization
- Created `docs/` directory
- Moved all documentation files to `docs/`:
  - BUILD_INSTALL.md
  - TSF_DEBUGGING.md
  - UNINSTALL_HELP.md
  - USAGE_GUIDE.md

### 2. Created New Files
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Shows current and proposed structure
- `README_NEW.md` - New main README with complete project overview

## Current Structure

```
keymagic-windows/
├── src/                    # TSF source files (mixed Rust/C++)
├── include/                # Headers
├── manager/                # GUI Manager app
│   ├── KeyMagicManager.exe (built)
│   └── source/build files
├── docs/                   # All documentation
├── examples/              
├── tests/
├── build_windows.bat      # TSF build
├── install.bat           # TSF install
└── (other scripts)
```

## Why This Organization

1. **Cleaner root directory** - Documentation moved to docs/
2. **Manager is separate** - GUI app in its own directory
3. **Easy to find things** - Clear separation of components
4. **Ready for future** - Can further reorganize TSF into subdirectory

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to fully implement the proposed structure:

1. Create `tsf/` subdirectory
2. Move TSF-related files (Cargo.toml, build.rs, src/) into tsf/
3. Update build scripts to work from new location
4. Move manager source into manager/src/

For now, the current organization with docs/ and manager/ separation should work well!
