### Summary

Phase 2 Core Engine Development is **COMPLETE**! We have:

1. **KM2 Loader**: Fully functional binary file parser supporting v1.3-1.5 formats
2. **Rule Engine**: Complete with pattern matching, greedy matching, recursive processing
   - Added Variable rule element support for variable substitution
   - Implemented rule sorting by priority (state count, VK count, character length)
3. **State Management**: Toggle states for context-sensitive input
   - Uses integer-based state storage for efficiency (`HashSet<usize>`)
   - State indices reference the strings table in KM2 format
4. **Virtual Key Support**: Including modifier combinations (Shift, Ctrl, Alt)
5. **Composing Buffer**: For multi-character input sequences
6. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 24 tests covering all major functionality
   - Metadata tests: 10 tests (all passing)
   - Variable tests: 6 tests (all passing)
   - Basic rule tests: 8 tests (all passing)

### Final Implementation Details

- **Rule Matching**: Supports String, Variable, AnyOf, NotAnyOf, Any, Predefined, and state-based rules
- **Pattern Matching**: Implements greedy matching with proper precedence
- **Recursive Processing**: Handles recursive rule application with stop conditions
- **Test Infrastructure**: Created test utilities for programmatic KM2 file generation

### Completion Date

**November 2024** - All tests passing, engine fully functional

### Next Steps (Phase 3 and beyond)

- Implement FFI layer for platform integration
- Create platform-specific IME integrations (Linux/IBus, macOS/IMK, Windows/TSF)
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Add support for more complex KMS features
- Real-world testing with existing KeyMagic keyboard layouts
