# Phase 5: Windows Integration Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. FFI Bridge Implementation ✅
- Created `ffi_v2.rs` with complete C-compatible API
- Handles engine lifecycle (create, free)
- Keyboard loading from KM2 files
- Key event processing with full modifier support
- Memory-safe string handling between Rust and C
- Proper error codes and result handling

### 2. C/C++ TSF Framework ✅
- **KeyMagicTextService.h/cpp**: Main TSF implementation
  - ITfTextInputProcessor interface
  - ITfThreadMgrEventSink for thread management
  - ITfKeyEventSink for keyboard input
  - Basic composition handling structure
- **DllMain.cpp**: COM registration and DLL entry points
- **keymagic.def**: Module definition for DLL exports

### 3. Build System ✅
- Configured `build.rs` to compile C++ sources
- Links required Windows libraries (user32, ole32, etc.)
- Supports cross-compilation with proper targets
- Module definition file integration

### 4. Testing Infrastructure ✅
- Unit tests for FFI layer
- Test utilities for creating KM2 structures
- C example program for testing FFI directly

## Current Architecture

```
Windows Application
        |
        v
Text Services Framework (TSF)
        |
        v
KeyMagicTextService (C++ COM Object)
        |
        v
FFI Bridge (keymagic_ffi_v2.h)
        |
        v
Rust FFI Layer (ffi_v2.rs)
        |
        v
KeyMagic Core Engine (keymagic-core)
```

## What's Working

1. **Engine Integration**: The Rust engine is fully accessible from C/C++
2. **Key Processing**: Virtual key codes are converted to engine input
3. **Output Handling**: Engine actions (Insert, Delete, etc.) are translated
4. **Memory Safety**: Proper string lifecycle management across FFI boundary
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes for all failure cases

## What Needs Completion

### 1. Full TSF Composition Implementation
- ITfComposition interface implementation
- Display attribute provider
- Proper text range management
- Candidate window support

### 2. Installation & Registration
- Automated DLL registration scripts
- Language profile management
- Settings UI for keyboard selection

### 3. Real-world Testing
- Test with various Windows applications
- Performance testing with complex keyboards
- Multi-monitor and DPI scaling support

### 4. UI Components
- Language bar integration
- Keyboard layout selection dialog
- About/help dialogs

## Next Steps for Full Completion

1. **Implement remaining TSF interfaces** for proper composition display
2. **Create installer** using WiX or similar
3. **Add keyboard management UI** for loading KM2 files
4. **Test with real KeyMagic keyboards** (Myanmar, etc.)
5. **Performance optimization** if needed
6. **Documentation** for end users

## Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Character mapping**: Currently using simple casting for character input
2. **Composition UI**: Needs full implementation for inline text display
3. **Settings persistence**: Need to save selected keyboard across sessions
4. **Hot key support**: Implement keyboard switching hotkeys
5. **Unicode surrogate pairs**: Ensure proper handling of complex Unicode

## How to Build and Test

```bash
# On Windows with Rust and Visual Studio installed
cd keymagic-windows
cargo build --release

# The DLL will be at:
# target/release/keymagic_windows.dll

# To register (as Administrator):
regsvr32 keymagic_windows.dll

# To test FFI directly:
cl examples/test_ffi.c /I include /link keymagic_windows.lib
test_ffi.exe
```

## Conclusion

Phase 5 has established a solid foundation for Windows TSF integration. The core functionality is in place with:
- ✅ Rust engine successfully integrated via FFI
- ✅ Basic TSF framework implemented
- ✅ Key event processing working
- ✅ Build system configured

The remaining work is primarily UI/UX polish and completing the TSF composition interfaces for a production-ready IME.
